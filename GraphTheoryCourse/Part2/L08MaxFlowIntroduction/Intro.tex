    \section{Overview Of Flow Network}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Introduction to Flow Graph, Maximum Flow and other terminologies.
        \item Ford- Fulkerson Algorithm for computation of maximum flow and its limitations.
        \item Edmond-Karp Algorithm \& its implementation
        \item Solving a related problem.
    \end{enumerate}

    \section{Network}
        A network is a directed graph G with vertex set V and edge set E combine with a function C which maps all edges (say e) to some non-negative integer (or real numbers) which is called the capacity of edge e.

    \section{Flow Network}
        Additionally in the network if we label $2$ nodes / vertices as \textbf{source} and \textbf{sink} this is called a flow network.
    
    \section{Flow}
        A function F which maps all edges (say e) to some non-negative integer (or real numbers) which is called the flow through edge e.
        The function has to fulfill $2$ conditions.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Flow of an edge can not exceed the capacity of that edge. \\
            $f(e) \leq c(e)$
            \item For all vertex $u$ (except \textbf{source} and \textbf{sink}), the sum of \textbf{\emph{in-flow}} should be equal to sum of \textbf{\emph{out-flow}}
        \end{enumerate}
    
    For source and sink, outFlow of source = inFlow of sink
